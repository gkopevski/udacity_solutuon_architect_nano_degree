Note Goran Kopevski: Since we do not have clear requirements to know for what kind of application we are creating I assumed we will have 50k monthly users. 8k budget is way too big. But since I needed to reduce, I reduced the s3 storage since I was too gracious, the mysql server was also reduced in half since we are going to store the files in s3 bucket. The thing which was important from my perspective is to have mysql with high throughput so we always be able to serve the users and not to have queues in inserting/reading the data. I intentionally did not reduce the ec2 instances since 500$ is already too much and reducing this metric can only compromise the performance and we do not want that. Also reduced the cost for trafic since here I was also too much gracious with the data that we transfer.
Generally speaking we need better requirements if we want to create proper and more concrete esstimate.
