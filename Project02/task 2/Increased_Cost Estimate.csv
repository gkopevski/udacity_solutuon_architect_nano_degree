Note Goran Kopevski: Since we have a lot of spare money these are the things which I increased will make:Have the whole infrastrcture in another region ready for worst case disaster recovery scenario. The sizes and amount of the instances do not need to be as large as in our primary region. For security will add WAF for our most crucial endpoints. Will add SQS between the web and application servers.
Will add Xray to monitor the data.In primary region will increase the size of the instances for all (web/application/rds).
Will increase the s3 since we are going big!
